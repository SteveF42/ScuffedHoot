<h3>Recreation of the popular game Kahoot</h3>
<p>Built with MongoDB, express, nodeJS, and vanilla JS.
 React would have been nice to use on the frontend as it would of made a lot of the code MUCH cleaner.
 Maybe at the same later date I could re write the frontend in React, for now it's a simple CRUD application.
